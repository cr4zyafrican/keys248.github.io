				<p>I created this website to as a place for me and others to reference most of my projects, including research, programming, and artistic, in an compiled and organized way. I also wanted to show my learned use of HTML and CSS through a project of its own.</p>

				<h2>About</h2>
				<p><img class="left" src="_img/bobst.jpg" align="left"> I love both carbon based life and silicon based life to equal extents. My mind is constantly blown by biology facts. Isn't it crazy how for every human cell in our body we have the same amount of non-human things living on or in us?<sup>1</sup> Gross but super cool. Sometimes I'll code for 6 hours straight and feel like only an hour passed. Also the Bash command line interface makes me feel safe. That's why I'm a Biologist and a Computer Scientist. I'm combining both passions through an open source, computational biology research project as an undergrad at NYU. Yes, I love how long that description is. Getting three minors inspired my hobby of collecting degrees, so I'm planning on a masters before applying to medical school. Catch me in the library.</p>

				<h2>Interests</h2>
				<p>Do you love open source? I love open source. You should love open source. Also check out this open source club I helped found at NYU. We have a cool website at <a href="https://bugs-nyu.github.io/" title="BUGS Website" target="_blank">bugs-nyu.github.io</a>.</p>
				<p>I also really like volunteering and neurology is a very interesting department where I've had the pleasure to spend my time. If you ever find yourself in the neurology unit of the New York Presbyterian, Weill Cornell Hospital you may just run into me.</p>
				<p>The Twilight Zone will always be my favorite TV show. Mr Robot, Rick and Morty, and Samurai Jack are enjoyable too. My current jam is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0zvLRnBoZaPhuqIfOkPMT1?si=PFumQ5XxRV-Trbxen6oiMg" title="Jealous Man song">Jealous Man by The Marcus King Band</a>. Check it out! I'm a cinephile and love to be moved by great films, so check out my slightly organized <a href="_doc/FavoriteFilmList" title="Favorite Film List">list of favorite films</a>.</p>
