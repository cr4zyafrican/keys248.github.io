				<h2 id="hunt-for-the-worlds-best-views">Hunt for the World's Best Views</h2>
				<p>Around 2012 I began to capture landscape views from various hikes and travels. Most of these photos come from hikes in California or my time in New York. Other photos are from travels around the U.S. and  the world. More photos can be found on my tumblr blog at <a href="http://www.best-views.tumblr.com" title="Best Views Tumblr" target="_blank">best-views.tumblr.com</a>.</p>

				<h2 id="drawn-views">Drawn Views</h2>
				<p>In order to create meaningful birthday gifts for my friends, I decided to make something for them. I chose to draw and watercolor 4 inch by 6 inch framed pieces based on previous photos I had taken that had a connection to the specific friend I was making it for. In this way the piece could be tailored to the specific friend, maintain a minimalist presence, and be built off my previous work. In this project I show the image the piece is based off, the drawing, and the final watercolor. More pieces from this project can be found on my tumblr blog at <a href="http://drawn-views.tumblr.com/" title="Drawn Views Tumblr" target="_blank">drawn-views.tumblr.com</a>.</p>

				<h2 id="animated-gifs">Animated Gifs</h2>
				<p>During photo shoots I thought it would be interesting to start capturing some timelapses. I decided to present these collected images in the form of animated gifs for easy sharing over the web. I haven't made enough of these to elicit creating a blog for them, but I have my favorite ones shown below.</p>
