				<h2 id="hunt">Hunt for the World's Best Views</h2>
				<p>Around 2012 I began an effort to capture landscape views from various hikes and travels. Most of these photos come from hikes in California or my time in New York. Other photos are from travels around the U.S. and  the world. More photos can be found on my tumblr blog at <a href="http://www.best-views.tumblr.com" title="Best Views Tumblr" target="_blank">best-views.tumblr.com</a>.</p>

				<h2 id="drawn">Drawn Views</h2>
				<p>In order to create meaningful birthday gifts for my friends without spending a lot of money, I decided to make something for them. I chose to draw and watercolor 4 inch by 6 inch framed pieces based on previous photos I had taken that had a connection to the specific friend I was making it for. In this way the piece could be tailored to the specific friend, maintain a minimalist presence, and be built off my previous work. In this project I show the image the piece is based off, the drawing, and the final watercolor. More pieces from this project can be found on my tumblr blog at <a href="http://drawn-views.tumblr.com/" title="Drawn Views Tumblr" target="_blank">drawn-views.tumblr.com</a>.</p>
				<p><img src="../_images/wsp_pic.jpg" alt="Washington Square Park Picture"><br>A view up Fifth Avenue in New York City for my Best Views project.</p>
				<p><img src="../_images/wsp_draw.jpg" alt="Washington Square Park Drawing"><br>The previous photo was then used to make this ink drawing.</p>
				<p><img src="../_images/wsp_color.JPG" alt="Washington Square Park Color"><br>The ink drawing was then watercolored to produce this final piece in its frame.</p>

				<h2 id="email">Automated Email</h2>
				<p>I wrote some programs that can automatically read and respond to your emails. There are many possible uses for types of programs including automated responses to specific messages, being able to control and get notifications on processes being run on remote computers, and pre-written emails scheduled to be sent later.</p>
				<p>Some basic examples for your configuration purposes are on my GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/KEYS248/simple-email-parsing" title="Simple Email Parsing" target="_blank">github.com/KEYS248/simple-email-parsing</a>.</p>
