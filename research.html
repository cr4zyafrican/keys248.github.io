				<h2 id="growth-rate-analysis">Growth Rate Analysis</h2>
				<p>The Turbidostat is an inexpensive, 3D printable, open source device developed by the Klavins Lab at the University of Washington. Their website and project can be found at <a href="http://klavinslab.org/hardware" title="Klavins Lab" target="_blank">klavinslab.org/hardware</a>. The device allows cells to grow at exponential rates while keeping the cell density relatively constant. This is done through the use of lasers that measure optical density and give feedback to the media delivery system which continuously removes waste and dilutes the solution with fresh media. This set up removes two important stresses from the growth environment: limited nutrients and cell density. In this way, the cells should not evolve to these types of common stresses.</p>

				<p>My current work involves additions to this open source Turbidostat project. I am specifically writing Python, R, and Bash programs to take optical density measurements from the lasers and calculate the growth rate of cells growing in tubes. Being able to accurately identify changes in growth rate is an important feature to add to this set up because it can be an indicator of evolution in the cell culture. This evolution may be something the experimenters may want to avoid or something they are hoping occurs after they introduce a novel stress. Either way, this feature will give them critical insight in this matter.</p>

				<p>Another program I have a stable build for runs separate from the main experiment programs but modifies their goal optical density dynamically depending on the current OD measurements. This adds the ability to have short segments of large dilutions followed by large periods of exponential growth without dilution, which allows for more accurate and precise growth rate measurements to be taken from that period of exponential growth.</p>
				<p class="center"><img class="center" src="_img/blocks.png" title="Block Dilutions">Graphical representation of the Block Dilutions program structure.</p>
				<p>One other small program simply keeps track of the dilutions made during the experiment and notifies the experiments with the current level of food media for the cells based on the starting amount.</p>
				<p class="center"><img class="center" src="_img/monitor.png" title="Media Monitor">Graphical representation of the Media Monitor program functions.</p>
				<p>The end goal of this pipeline contribution is to have entirely independent pipelines with the ability to dynamically and automatically allow large stretches of growth without dilution, measure growth rates, compute general statistics, analyze signifiant changes, compare experimental results with expected results, generate graphs, and notify experimenters with revelant information.</p>
				<p>There is still some more work to get done on this project. A list of completed and to-be completed tasks is listed at <a href="https://github.com/Siegallab/Flexostat-interface#todo" title="Growth Rate TODO" target="_blank">github.com/Siegallab/Flexostat-interface#todo</a>, along with all our current code in that same repository.

				<h2 id="disa-literature-review">DisA Literature Review</h2>
				<p>This literature review was the main project required for completion of the Microbiology and Microbial Genomics course, an NYU Biology upper level elective.</p>
				<p>Spores exist in a metabolically inactive state that limits their ability to fend of DNA damage that accumulates before germination. It is only in the transition stages between spore and bacteria do DNA repair mechanisms re-active. The regulatory protein DisA has previously been shown to delay sporulation when DNA damage is found, but more recently has been shown to also delay outgrowth of a spore in a similar way. This paper explores recent findings in how DisA works in concert with DNA repair mechanisms, how it communicates regulatory messages, and its connections with other regulatory proteins during the germination stages.</p>

				<h2 id="image-analysis-pipeline">Image Analysis Pipeline</h2>
				<p>The image analysis pipeline starts with an automated microscope taking and saving images of growing yeast, producing in total a few tens of thousands of images per experiment. These images are transfered from the local lab computer to NYU's High Performance Computing network, where we run software on each image that produces around two hundred data points per image. Occasionally the images encounter errors during the analysis process because they took too long, took too much memory, or some other reason. These images have to be re-run with more time and memory dedicated to them.</p>
				<p>My work on this project involved improving the code that handles all this communications of images between the local and HPC network. Specifically, I changed Bash scripts to well documented, compartmentalized , and improved Python scripts.</p>
				<p>The code for the work that was done on this project can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Siegallab/image-analysis-pipeline" title="Image Analysis GitHub" target="_blank">github.com/Siegallab/image-analysis-pipeline</a>.</p>

				<h2 id="microbial-fuel-cells">Microbial Fuel Cells</h2>
				<p>Microbial fuel cells (or MFCs) utilize the natural metabolism of bacteria for generating electricity. At the end of a normal electron transport chain, the metabolism of organic material drives electrons across the inner mitochondrial, pumping hydrogen into the inter-membrane space for later ATP production, and uses hydrogen and oxygen as final electron acceptors to produce water. Microbial fuel cells have an anode that bacteria form a biofilm on and utilize as the final electron acceptor instead of an electron transport chain. The electron runs to a cathode, creating an electrical current that produces energy we can use, and combines with oxygen at the cathode to produce water. This technology can be used in water treatment plants, where bacteria metabolize waste water and this technology can capture electricity from the process.</p>
				<p class="center"><img class="center" src="_img/microbial_fuel_cells.png" title="Microbial Fuel Cells">Graphical representation of a microbial fuel cell.</p>
				<p>My internship in a Tel Aviv University biology lab involved research in making microbial fuel cells more efficient. Currently, MFCs are only able to general small amounts of energy. I studied the effects of graphite and felt anodes for use in MFCs, as well as which bacteria seems to be the most present within the MFC solution and on the anode. Measures including voltage, pH, conductivity of solution, and ammonium concentration were measured. The main conclusion of the experiment was that the felt brush anode produced higher voltage than the graphite. To recieve academic credit towards my Biology BA, I was required to do a few presentations as well as write a short report of my research. That report can be found below.</p>
